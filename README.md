# waxfetch
Neofetch for WaxusBS. Made as cork for wsh (gonna test WaxusBS with this stuff).

Currently using MIT License cuz it is not that big as GNU GPL 3.0. Anyway you can copy this repo and fork it. Plz, if it is not hard for you, mention WaxusBS or Morlix team. We still can't make our OS popular because we don't even have any people in our team, who could take YouTube/TikTok/Twitch/etc. channels
